Energize is my brainchild, a testament to my full-stack development skills. At its core, it utilizes a monolithic architecture, a strategic choice given its current scope. This approach streamlines development and debugging for a smaller-scale project. However, I'm fully prepared to transition to a microservices architecture when scalability becomes a priority, ensuring that Energize can grow and evolve as needed.

## Tech Stack
Here’s the breakdown:

### Front End

- **JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS**

    ![JavaScript](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js&theme=light) ![React](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react&theme=light) ![TailwindCSS](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=tailwind&theme=light)

For the front end, I've chosen **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 

**JavaScript** is the bedrock of web interactivity, and its asynchronous nature is ideal for real-time applications like nutrition and exercise trackers. 

**React’s** component-based architecture ensures a seamless user experience with efficient rendering and state management, crucial for interactive elements like progress trackers and dynamic forms. 

**TailwindCSS** is the cherry on top, offering a utility-first approach for rapid, responsive UI development. 

This combination not only boosts development efficiency but also ensures a high-performance, user-friendly interface.

### Back End

- **TypeScript, MySQL, Express**

    ![TypeScript](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts&theme=light) ![MySQL](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=mysql&theme=light) ![Express](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=express&theme=light)

On the back end, I've ventured out of my comfort zone with **TypeScript**, **MySQL**, and **Express**. 

**TypeScript** offers the robustness of type safety and aligns well with my front-end React code, enhancing maintainability and reducing bugs.

**MySQL** is my choice for a relational database because of its reliability and scalability, key for managing detailed user data and exercise logs.

**Express**, with its minimalist and flexible nature, forms the backbone of my server-side logic, integrating seamlessly with **TypeScript** and **MySQL**. 

This stack was chosen not just for its strengths but for how these technologies synergistically create a robust, scalable, and efficient back-end system, ready to handle complex operations and data management with ease.
